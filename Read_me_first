# intro :

this Bot uses Proxies that you should save into the file  proxylist.txt
in the format ip:port one proxy per line

52.23.214.104:3128
34.196.168.93:3129
89.46.67.28:3128

then you Open  the twitch_bot.py python script to eddit the folosing line :

# configuratiom
# channel URL (formatt this way twitch.tv/raffledog )
channel_url = "twitch.tv/raffledog"
# Mul is an integer that shows how many Views you will get from one proxy
# max 10 recommended 5
Mul = 5
# n defines the randomness of the delay  between the Views to avoid Bot detection
n = 8

The comments explains all ,

then run the python script , this script will get a Token url for each View
and make a HEAD request only to minimise the bandwith used by the script
# PS :
